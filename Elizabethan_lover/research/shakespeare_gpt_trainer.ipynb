For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## Task 2: The Surgical Cleanup (Fail & Fix)\n\n**What:**\nWe will process the raw text to isolate the Shakespearean content using a multi-stage filter.\n\n**Why:**\n**The Fix:** Our initial diagnosis (Task 1) proved the existence of metadata noise.\n* **Slicing:** We identified that the content begins at line 80 and ends 359 lines before the file closes.

We fixed this with surgical slicing `[80:-359]`.\n* **The Baseline Fail:** A Bigram model (looking at 1 character context) achieved a Loss of **2.64**. It produced words, but zero sentence structure.\n\n### **2. The Fix: Self-Attention**\nWe implemented a **GPT-style Transformer** with:\n* **4 Self-Attention Heads:** allowing the model to look back at previous tokens for context.\n* **Feed-Forward Networks:** for internal processing.\n* **Residual Connections:** to allow deep learning without gradient loss.\n\n### **3. Final Results**\n* **Final Loss:** The loss dropped to **1.84** (significantly better than the 2.64 baseline).\n* **Structural Integrity:** The final output demonstrates valid character names, correct play script formatting, and coherent syntax.\n\n### **4.
