**The Elizabethan Lover** is a full-stack Generative AI application that simulates a "Snapchat" experience with historical figures. Unlike generic chatbots, this project enforces rigid historical personas (Shakespeare, Romeo, Juliet) using System Prompt Engineering and Google's **Gemini 2.5 Flash** architecture.

## 📖 The "Fail & Fix" Architecture Story

This project is a tale of two halves: **The Data Science** (Research) and **The Product Engineering** (Web).

### 🧪 Phase 1: The Research (The "Fail")
*Located in `/research`*

I initially attempted to build a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch to understand the math behind the magic.
* **The Goal:** Train a Transformer model on the complete works of William Shakespeare (`pg100.txt`).
* **The Fail:**
    1.  **Dirty Data:** The raw dataset contained 20% legal boilerplate, causing the model to generate copyright notices instead of poetry.
    2.  **Goldfish Memory:** My custom Transformer model (built with PyTorch) had a limited context window (64 characters) and was computationally expensive to host.
* **The Fix:** I wrote a custom cleaning pipeline to surgically slice the text and validated the Self-Attention architecture, achieving a Cross-Entropy Loss drop from **2.64** (Bigram) to **1.84** (GPT).

### 🚀 Phase 2: The Product (The "Fix")
*Located in `/web`*

To build a viable production app with low latency, I pivoted the architecture.
* **The Brain:** I replaced the custom model with **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**.
* **The Pivot:** Instead of training a model, I used **System Prompt Engineering** to create distinct personas for Shakespeare, Romeo, and Juliet.
* **The Challenge:** The AI initially refused to be romantic (Google Safety Filters). I had to programmatically disable specific harassment/sexual filters to allow Romeo to be "impulsive and dramatic" without crashing the app.
* **The UI:** A mobile-first "Snapchat Clone" built with Vanilla JS and CSS Flexbox to handle dynamic viewport heights (`100dvh`) on mobile devices.

cd Elizabethan-Lover
```

### 2\. Setup the Environment

Navigate to the web folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd web
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3\. Configure Secrets

Create a `.env` file inside the `web` folder:

```text
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 4\. Wake the Bard

Run the Flask server:

```bash
python api/chat.py
```

*You should see: `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000`*

### 5\. Open the Frontend

Open `web/public/index.html` in your browser.
